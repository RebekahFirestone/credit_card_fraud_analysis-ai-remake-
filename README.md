Using AI helped me to create this notebook faster by reducing the time spent recalling specific syntax. It came up with the implementation for what I wanted and debugged its work. Additionally, AIâ€™s ability to optimize code made the implementation more efficient.

Without an understanding of data science, relying on AI is risky. Misinterpreting graphs and metrics from AI can lead to flawed assumptions, especially contexts like fraud detection. Verifying AI results with my own knowledge was crucial to ensure accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the importance of foundational skills when using AI in data science.
